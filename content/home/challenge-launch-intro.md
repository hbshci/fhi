The Health Acceleration Challenge is a “scale up” competition that focuses on compelling, already-implemented health care solutions and helps them to grow and increase their impact through powerful networking and funding opportunities.

The four finalists will share the $150,000 Cox Prize, have an HBS case study written about their innovation and have the opportunity to present at the Forum on Health Care Innovation conference to 150 senior health care executives next April.
