The Forum on Health Care Innovation is a collaboration between [Harvard Business School]({{gsheets.links.hbs-main.url}}) (HBS) and [Harvard Medical School]({{gsheets.links.hms-main.url}}) (HMS). Its purpose is to unite leading executives, policymakers, and academics in a cross-disciplinary exploration of innovative actions to improve quality, reduce costs, and, ultimately, increase value in the health care industry.

The Forum's [initial event]( {{rel 'conference'}} ) was a conference and survey that were summarized in [Five Key Imperatives]({{rel 'conference/#thought-leadership'}}).

In 2014 the Forum launched the [Health Acceleration Challenge]({{gsheets.links.challenge-main.url}}) to identify and promote demonstrated health care innovations, and selected [four finalists]({{gsheets.links.challenge-application.url}}) to share the Cox Prize.

> I discovered both the enormous gratitude each one of us has as individuals for health care and the equally enormous frustration any one of us has as a consumer of the health care system. Our challenge is: How can we realize the great magic, and the great benefits, that health care can afford?

> We need approaches to the solutions that arenâ€™t just arithmetic and additive, but are in some sense logarithmic. This will require us to reach across historic boundaries and unlock the potential of collaboration across the usual disciplines.
