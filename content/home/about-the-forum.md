The Forum on Health Care Innovation is a collaboration between [Harvard Business School]({{gsheets.links.hbs-main.url}}) (HBS) and [Harvard Medical School]({{gsheets.links.hms-main.url}}) (HMS). Its purpose is to unite leading executives, policymakers, and academics in a cross-disciplinary exploration of innovative actions to improve quality, reduce costs, and, ultimately, increase value in the health care industry.

The Forum's [initial event]({{gsheets.links.conference-2012-main.url}}) was a conference and survey that was summarized in [Five Key Imperatives]({{gsheets.links.conference-2012-5-imperatives.url}}).

The Forum has now launched the [Health Acceleration Challenge]({{gsheets.links.challenge-main.url}}) to identify and promote demonstrated health care innovations. Find out more and [apply today]({{gsheets.links.challenge-application.url}})!

> We need approaches to the solutions that aren’t just arithmetic and additive, but are in some sense logarithmic. This will require us to reach across historic boundaries and unlock the potential of collaboration across the usual disciplines.
