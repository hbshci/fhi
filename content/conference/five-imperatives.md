A key output of the previous conference was a report entitled "5 Imperatives," which outlined the five key steps to fostering innovation in health care. Participants agreed that there is no "magic bullet" that can heroically resolve our health care challenges. Instead, the most intriguing ideas share common themes of collaboration, integration, and distributed knowledge. The 5 key imperatives are:

1. #### Making value the central objective

	In isolation, efforts to either reduce costs or improve outcomes are insufficient; we need to do both through care coordination and shared information.

1. #### Promoting novel approaches to process improvement

	Instead of largely focusing on product innovation, we also must create an environment that encourages process improvement and acknowledges that "failure" represents an important component of experimentation and learning. 

1. #### Making consumerism really work

	Today, consumerism remains a strong idea with weak means of execution. We will achieve greater success when providers organize efforts around patient needs and when patients become more active agents in managing their own health. 

1. #### Decentralizing approaches to problem solving

	We should facilitate the movement of care delivery and health care innovation from centralized centers of expertise out to the periphery, where more providers, innovators, and patients can engage in collaborative improvement efforts. 

1. #### Integrating new approaches into established organizations

	Our future must build on past successes. Existing health care institutions must be reinforced with efforts to integrate new knowledge into established organizations and the communities they serve.
