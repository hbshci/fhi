We’re looking for proven ideas that have the potential to do great things for the U.S. health care delivery system.  It is widely known that health care innovations are much slower to disseminate than comparable solutions in other industries.  We want to help speed up the process.  What’s your innovation?

Innovations must have credible, demonstrated evidence of their value proposition (such as cost savings, outcomes improvement, patient satisfaction, etc.); have a compelling dissemination plan; and be at the cusp of scaling.
