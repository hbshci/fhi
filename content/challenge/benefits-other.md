### Exposure

In addition to the press and marketing for the Health Acceleration Challenge and our conference, the ideas of our finalists will be widely distributed to alumni. 

### Financial Award 

Our finalists will split ${{addCommas gsheets.snippets.challenge-prize-grand-amt.val}} as determined by our judges. Funding for finalists will be awarded in 2015, and an additional ${{addCommas gsheets.snippets.challenge-prize-one-year-later.val}} will be awarded a year later to the organization that has had the most success in scaling up.

### Community Feedback

Applicants will receive invaluable feedback on their innovation and scale-up plan from a community of health care executives and entrepreneurs through our Health Acceleration Challenge platform. We hope that our process will assist you in finding new investors, customers and collaborators, even if you are not selected as a finalist in our Challenge.
