1. #### What is the Forum on Health Care Innovation?

    The Forum on Health Care Innovation is a collaboration between [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu/healthcare) (HBS) and [Harvard Medical School](http://hms.harvard.edu/) (HMS). Its purpose is to unite leading executives, policymakers, and academics in a cross-disciplinary exploration of innovative actions to improve quality, reduce costs, and, ultimately, increase value in the health care industry. 

1. #### What is the Health Acceleration Challenge?

    Our Challenge aims to identify and promote innovations that have credible, demonstrated evidence to generate significant value for the U.S. health care delivery system. In particular, we are looking for proven ideas that, if more broadly disseminated, could move the needle on cost, quality or access.

1. #### What do you mean by "demonstrated value" and "potential to scale rapidly"?

    We want to see credible evidence from existing sites, pilots or customers that your innovation works. The more evidence you can provide, the stronger your application. Your innovation does not necessarily have to be in final product form for commercialization, but you do need to provide a solid dissemination plan of how you will overcome barriers to adoption across the US.

1. #### What are examples of "credible evidence"?

    You determine what your best evidence is. It could be quantitative data from existing pilots showing improved patient outcomes, customer satisfaction data, cost-savings documentation, or anything else that demonstrates success.

1. #### Are participants supposed to solve a specific problem?

    Innovation and value creation for health care delivery can come in many shapes and sizes, from process improvement and new business models to software or hardware innovations. As a result, we want you to tell us how your innovation has created value for patients, customers or the delivery system, and why your idea will be able to transform U.S. health care delivery.

1. #### What are the benefits of participating?

    If you are a finalist, your innovation will be discussed at our invitation-only conference in {{formatDate gsheets.dates.conference-date-main.dateFrom gsheets.formatting.date-month-withYear.fmt}} during a case discussion led by senior Harvard faculty. You will have the opportunity to meet with potential customers, investors and partners at the conference dinner. Finalists also will benefit from feedback from our community of health care leaders and entrepreneurs, announcements to over {{addCommas gsheets.snippets.num-hbs-hms-alumni-access-to.val}} HBS and HMS alumni, and funding of up to ${{addCommas gsheets.snippets.challenge-prize-grand-amt.val}}.

1. #### How do teams apply?

    Please submit your application [here]({{gsheets.links.challenge-application.url}}). Applications close on {{> date-challenge-due}}.

1. #### How is this different from other Challenges?

    We believe innovations need to spread faster. We are focused on speeding up the adoption of innovations that have already demonstrated value and that could benefit from wider dissemination through the powerful combination of the participants in the Forum on Health Care Innovation and the Harvard faculty and alumni network. We are not a business plan competition. 

1. #### Who should apply to the Health Acceleration Challenge?

    We welcome applications from all types of people—individuals and teams, clinicians and administrators, technologists and scientists, and those inside or outside the health care industry—anyone with a proven health care innovation.   All types of organizations are invited to apply as well—established or early stage, for profit or non-profit, from within the United States or outside.  

1. #### Do I have to be a for-profit entity?

    No. For-profit and non-profit ideas are both welcomed for consideration.

1. #### Do I have to be based in the United States or Boston?

    No. You can be based anywhere in the world, however your solution needs to be applicable to the U.S. health care delivery system, and you need to have a credible plan on how to deliver your solution in the U.S. market.

1. #### What are you not looking for?

    Pharmaceutical, biotech, medical device, and diagnostic technologies may not be the best fit for this Challenge, unless they have a demonstrated impact on improving care-delivery processes beyond typical product interventions.

1. #### How far along does my innovation have to be?

    The application is open to any organization or solution ranging from nearly developed to fully developed to the early stages of deployment. However, you need credible demonstrated evidence that your solution can significantly impact the U.S. health care delivery system.  This means your solution needs to be implemented in at least one setting.

1. #### What criteria will the evaluation committee use?

    Our judging panel will evaluate applications based on [criteria](#{{gsheets.nav.challenge-challenge-criteria.navId}}) such as impact and value creation potential, credible evidence of idea, dissemination plan, and other participants' comments.

1. #### I am not a Harvard alum. Can I still apply?

    Absolutely! Anyone can participate in the Health Acceleration Challenge.

1. #### I want to participate but don't have an innovation. How much time and effort does it take to be a part of the Challenge?

    Participants can contribute on a variety of levels, ranging from applauding ideas to contributing complex concepts. Being a part of our Challenge requires anywhere from a few minutes to many hours. It's totally up to you! Sharing insightful comments on other people's ideas on the Health Acceleration Challenge platform **could earn you free tickets to our invite-only conference** even if you are not a Challenge applicant.

1. #### What happens to my intellectual property on the Health Acceleration Challenge platform?

    Our application does not ask for detailed IP information, and there is no reason you have to disclose this to anyone on the platform if you are not comfortable doing so.
